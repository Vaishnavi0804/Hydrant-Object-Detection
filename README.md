# Hydrant-Object-Detection
DAEN-690-002 : Team Phoenix working with the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department

This project is about building a detection model that can detect and locate fire hydrants in images or videos. We anticipate learning more about the difficulties, best practices, and restrictions associated with object identification and computer vision, and any requirements for system enhancements.
